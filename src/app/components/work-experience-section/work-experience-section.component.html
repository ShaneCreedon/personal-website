                <p class="header-field"> Brightflag (Current)</p> <br/>
                <b> Graduate Software Engineer </b> <br/>
                Current employed as a Software Engineer at Brightflag (<a href="https://www.brightflag.com/">https://www.brightflag.com/</a>)
                <br><br>
                I have been working here for over a year and have grown a lot in terms of my software ability and understanding
                of how teams interact within an organisation, as well as how to optimize those interactions from maximum productivity.
                In terms of technical knowledge, my ability with Java, and SQL have improved immensely and I have learned many new skills like:
                React, and a proper grounding with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Unit testing and Integration testing
                were an utmost focus, to which we always aimed for above 80% test coverage with all of our Pull Requests to reduce the likelihood
                of introducing new defects into the system. We used SonarCloud for this purpose, which also enabled cleaner code by detecting
                code smells. Jenkins with CI/CD pipelines and environmental deployments were also a focus to which we had to of course,
                prioritise work around.
                <br><br>
                I've worked on many different things at my time here, but too many to go into detail about in this summary paragraph,
                so I will just leave a set of areas to which I've now worked in and understand to some level of thoroughness.
                Data migration, Building public APIs, SAML (Single Sign On) and SCIM for user provisioning APIs,
                Creation/Update public APIs, Internal tooling within the organisation to improve process and save large bodies of time.
                AWS and understanding of the various services like S3, CloudWatch, EC2.
