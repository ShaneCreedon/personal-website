            <p class="header-field"> My Story </p>
            Hi, I'm Shane, a 24 year old software engineer from Dublin, Ireland. <br>
            I Studied <b>B.Sc in Computer Applications and Software engineering (DC121)</b> in DCU (Dublin City University) and
            currently work at <a href="https://brightflag.com/">Brightflag</a>. <br> <br>

            I've always had an interest in technology. I was always fascinated with how technology worked, how games or web applications
            were developed. As a result of this interest, I started programming in small doses during school and began to
            involve myself in the software community in general. School never gave me the knowledge from any direct course or module
            to understand how technology in general worked so I decided to pursue this interest and enroll in a Computer Science degree.
            Four years later, I've graduated with a first-class honors degree, and that fire to build more software projects
            continues to rage on.

            <p class="header-field"> My Hobbies and Interests </p>
            Like most children growing up during the 1990s and early 2000s, video games were a big part of my life. 
            Upon playing my very first game, I felt an immediate attachment and love for it. Gaming was certainly the
            primary reason why I had a curiosity about Computer Science. <br> <br>
            Similarly, music has also been a passion of mine.
            I play guitar on a regular basis. Often playing pieces from a variety of genres that I enjoy.
            Being creative with programming and working on side-projects is also certainly a passion. I also love contributing
            to Open Source in my spare time.

            <p class="header-field"> My Aspirations and Career Goals </p>
            I want to grow in all aspects of the software engineering field, whether that be improving my own engineering
            ability or simply improving my soft skills. I want to learn to understand all of the different facets under the
            Computer Science umbrella. Because of this particular interest, I already have built projects spanning many domains
            in the field, whether that be Web Application Development, Mobile development, Machine Learning modeling/Data Science
            and Game Development. <br> <br>
            I want to be the best I can at my job and meet great people
            along the way. I also want to work for a company that which I care about the work they do and strive to pursue
            each and every day. Alternatively, setting up my own business is another ambition I hope to realise one day,
            but until that day, Let's see where the wind takes me.
